# Reading Prep: Binding

#### Olivia Taylor

## Questions or Observations

1.  In "How to design an awarded letterpress printed book," Dias and Dantas use the attributes of creating the book - font, size, material, and binding - to further convey the message of the author. Can we use the object itself not only to enhance the message of a story, but perhaps to incorporate a different message or feeling? Further, can the printing and binding process be used to contradict the content as an artistic choice?

2. "Letterpress goes for a hike" explores Schmittle's interwoven relationship with hiking and the press, while Driscoll and Squires study the relation of ferries and old books in “‘Oh Look, a Ferry’; or the Smell of Printed Books.” While these ideas are different, they connect in a theme of using books as symbols for abstract ideas. Is the idea of a book a personal metaphor, or do the emotional ties form a greater social ideograph?

3. Baxter's Procrustes proved the importance of the book as an object, given value despite its lack of content. It made me think about how some of the books I have on display I have not yet read - how else do we use books as objects in our society, apart from their content?
