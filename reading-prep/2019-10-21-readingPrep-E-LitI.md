# Reading Prep: E-Lit I

#### Olivia Taylor

## Questions or Observations

1.  Some students read *The Book* electronically, and lost the juxtaposition of definitions on pages within the text. When we lose this element in e-readers, what ways can we design a digital media to have the same effect? Is it better for this media to mimic a traditional codex, or are there other mechanisms?

2. Studies argue that comprehension declines while reading electronically. However, digital media allows for access to infinite resources. Is a shift to electronics damaging learning from the point of quality over quantity, or does the vast amount of information available outweigh the negatives and enhance our learning?

3. In "What Football Will Look Like in the Future", Bois uses space, color, position, and multimedia to convey a story. One choice I enjoyed was using empty space on a calendar to make the passage of time in the literature feel more tangible. In what other ways can we use digital media to invoke feelings that a physical codex cannot?
