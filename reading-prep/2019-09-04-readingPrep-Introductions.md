## Questions or Observations

1.  The role of books can be vastly different in the live of two people,
    or two societies. “The Bookmaking Habits of Select Species” by Ken
    Liu describes how books and information can be interpreted and
    preserved in different societies, from the lens of a foreigner. How,
    though, do these values combine at an individual level? How do books
    contribute differently to the lives of individuals?

2.  With the dawn of technology, not only do we lose connection to “the
    original”, but many new works do not have an original at all, but
    live in a digital world. What happens to our history, legacy, and
    livelihood if this technology fails someday? (based on Josephine
    Livingston, “What Do Our Oldest Books Say About Us?”)

3.  Kit Davey’s Instagram utilizes different mediums to tell a visual
    story through books. While challenging the conventions of a book,
    each design feels very recognizable as a book. How have we developed
    the innate ability to recognize something despite atypicality?
