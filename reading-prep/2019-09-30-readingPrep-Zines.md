# Reading Prep: Zines

#### Olivia Taylor

## Questions or Observations

1.  Pagan Kennedy discusses the feeling of freedom, moving to the boundless zine from the rigid expectations of novel writing. How can fiction writing, something that is meant as a form of self-expression, be so limiting? Beyond books, how do different art forms have different limits based on society, but are all accepted in society in one way or another?

2. Erasure poetry takes words from another work and transforms them into a new message. In this art form, is there ever an obligation to honor the original work in the new message? Or, on a similar vein, contradict it?

3. Reading Pagan Kennedy's zine and the work on Traces gives a sense of how personal and emotional zines can be. In creating a code of ethics, there is an emphasis on protecting the writer, both in their privacy and their right to their work. If writing is a form of communication, where do we draw the line on how public writing can be, especially when we can't communicate with the author to understand their intentions?
