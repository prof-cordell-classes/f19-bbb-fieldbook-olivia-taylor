# Reading Prep: Book Alterities

#### Olivia Taylor

## Questions or Observations

1.  The field of biological and genetic engineering often raises ethical concerns. Is the genetic modification of an organism, even as small as a bacterium, for the sake of art an ethical endeavor?

2. With altering books, we see the book regain value as the contents are transformed. How much do we value content over the object in these situations?

3. Carrion talks about "the new book" as a shift in the content of books, whereas Mod describes "the future book" as a change in how our society interacts with books. Is it truly that we are seeing shifts in what a book is, or could it be that we are finding new meaning in the previously established, broad definition of book?
