# Reading Prep: Print I

## Questions or Observations

1.  In *The Machine That Made Us*, Fry describes the artistry that went into Gutenburg's printing, such as the use of eight different versions of the letter "e" to get the perfect look, and the illumination done after printing. The readings frame the use of the letter press today as a contemporary art. How do we value artistry as we move to newer technology for reasons of efficiency and access? Do we appreciate the artistic elements of modern technology, or take them for granted in comparing to the past?

2.  Crawford describes how to utilize the printing press in a modern world to get a vintage look, while Fleishman goes further to describe how technology has developed to make letter press printing easier than ever. If the fascination of letter pressed media is one of nostalgia, is there an element of inauthenticity in trying to apply modern technology to the process?

3.  Lynch looks beyond the text in her article "How I Came to Love the En Space". While originally added for ease of reading, spaces early on became an aspect of the artistry, and remain a component of aesthetic today. How does something as simple as blank space resonate so deeply with us?
