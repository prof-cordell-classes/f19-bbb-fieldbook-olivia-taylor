# Reading Prep: What is a Book?

#### Olivia Taylor

## Questions or Observations

1.  Through the history of the development of the book, practices
    evolved. Some of these practices were lost or altered over time,
    while some developed into our modern codex. The title page of the
    book developed around 1480. Itâ€™s purpose was, and still is today, to
    identify the contents of a book. However, modern books introduce the
    title of the book on the cover and spine. Yet, title pages are still
    common place despite their redundancy, and flipping to a title page
    has a sentiment for the reader. Why did this practice survive, and
    why is it so important to us as the reader despite its lack of
    function?

2.  Sumerian princess Enheduanna was credited as the first named author,
    composing poems to the moon goddess Inhanna to whom she addressed as
    herself. Nowadays, the author has a significant connection to their
    book(s). In fact, I feel as though the definition of a book as it
    takes form for me is a communication from author to audience,
    whether it be information, a story, or a belief. In this sense, can
    we also attribute Enheduanna with the creation of the first books?
    How do we classify inscriptions that came before with this
    definition in mind, and is there a modern day equivalent that we
    would or would not consider a book?

3.  Borsuk describes how the early years of the printed codex marks not
    only a significant technological shift, but a philosophical one. She
    argues that they became intimate spaces for the individual, in
    ownership and in experience. With shifts in technology today, in the
    wake of the internet and the e-reader, access to books are becoming
    more wide-spread, just as they did with the invention of the
    printing press. Are we experiencing a similar cultural transition in
    how we relate to books?
