## Questions or Observations

1.  I was immediately drawn to the font Apercu because it felt both modern and comforting. I realized I recognized it from the branding of Glossier, a makeup company that promotes natural looks. The font helps convey this playful yet modern vibe of the company, however I also associate the aesthetic of the company with the font. Is it the actual letter form that makes us feel a certain way, or is it how it is used in our culture that gives it its meaning?

2.  Artists find inspiration for fonts in many different ways - Mrs. Eaves is a persona, Bushwick is the culture of a neighborhood. How are we able to give letterform such character, and is there really a way to perceive this character without being told?

3.  Logotype uses letters to create a distinct visual image, sometimes in a very abstract way. How far can we interpret letters and still have them be recognizable? More generally, how can we take simple letter forms and transform them endlessly to create different fonts, but always remain obviously the characters we know?
