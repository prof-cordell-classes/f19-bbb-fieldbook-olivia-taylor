# Reading Prep: E-Lit II

## Questions or Observations

1.  In molecular simulations, boundary conditions help to model an infinite system. When reading through "etheric ocean" I thought about how the screen acts as a boundary to a seemingly infinite scroll, whether horizontal or vertical. How does this sense of a physical boundary influence our perception of a work?

2. "With those we loved alive" absorbed me, however the fantasy was broken with a technical glitch on the purple links. How do the imperfections of digital technologies negatively effect this type of literature?

3. I explored "The Dead Tower" and opened it twice before I figured out how to navigate the piece. How does the necessity to have to navigate a new media affect our perception, especially when it feels counterintuitive?
