# Reading Prep: Fabrication II : Paper Circuits

#### Olivia Taylor

## Questions or Observations

1.  The humanities have always adapted to using modern technology to their benefit, from the printing press to word processing. In turn, the humanities support the progress of technology. How can we see this trend fit in with the serge of material-digital interface like 3D printing?

2. How does engaging our sense of touch add to our experience in learning and understanding at museums? How does this relate to our experience when reading a book?

3. Why do we have a tendency to try to combine older media with newer media, like making plastic feel like ivory or juxtaposing paper and silicon for a bibliocircuit?
