# Reflective: Book Alterities

## Is it a book?


In most of my reflections up to date, I have built upon my definition of a book, creating a broad definition. Last week, I slowly began to find there are edge cases that I do not personally include as a book per my definition. This week, I have had the opportunity to interact with many edge cases, book alterities, that pushed my understanding of a book.

The conflict of is it or is it not a book started with the readings on *The Xenotext*. The book itself is a retelling of the journey to complete the project; this, by nearly any definition, is a book. However, the genetic poem itself raises questions for me. I will not believe this to be a book, for there is no reader. The poem lives within the bacteria, and is distributed as the bacteria reproduced. However, the content is not interpreted for its meaning, only as a code. The meaning of the poem itself is lost, and therefore it loses its ability to be a book.

I also think there are ethical concerns with this project. Genetic engineering, generally, is surrounded by many concerns over ethics. Although it is just the genetic engineering of bacteria, it is only for the purpose of art, and there is no tangible benefit that it will have for mankind. Performing scientific research like this should only be done when absolutely necessary, and using genes as a sort of performance art is going to loosen the ethical ground that is currently deemed acceptable. Not only do I not see this project as a book, I do not support it as art.

I do believe books are evolving. I liked how in his article, Mod discusses "the future book", describing changes in how we interact with the book. I think that is valid, where as our technology evolves, our methods of communication will evolve, and as a result our relationship with books will evolve. This opens up the doors for new platforms, such as e-literature. My beliefs don't align as well with Carrion's article, though. He describes a new book vs. an old book, in a way that feels cryptic and almost fantastical. If we deviate from our conception of the old book too much, I am afraid this "new book" is not a book at all, but a new art form entirely. I think in pushing the limits of a book, we have to be careful to preserve some of the characteristics of communication, structure, and purpose. These thoughts brought me back to looking through Kit Davey's instagram. In class the first week, there were differing opinions on whether her art books can be considered books. I felt like many of them were books, as I recognized them as books without much thought. Others felt like more of a stretch. My definition of a book comes a lot from from instinctive reactions. On first glance, if asked what the subject in question is, would I say a book?

In class, I felt like I was able to be a little less skeptical of book alterities. I began reading one of these books like a traditional codex. I was able to understand the imagery of ribs juxtaposed with sketches of a city. The story read linearly. However,  Professor Cordell came over and effectively blew my mind when he took the book and opened it up in a third dimension. It became a 3D model of a rib cage, with stories that could be read in many different directions and still make sense. This also added another dimension to the city sketches, allowing the buildings to stand up. With just a little creativity on the part of the reader, the author conveys many layers of meaning.

This experience did make me think about how far we can push the limits of the book. I think it is important to ask ourselves if we feel like something is a book, and from there be able to reason why or why not. As the semester goes on, I have built a toolbox of arguments in favor of or against something being a book. As books become more complex, it is important for me, as well as society as a whole, to be able to reason through the choice of calling it a book.
