## How do we begin to define a book?

Before last week, I took books for granted. I had never thought to ask the definition of a book, nor have I been asked for it - it seems as much a part of nature as the ground beneath my feet. Within just a couple of classes and readings, I will never be able to look at a book the same again. I see it more clearly than ever, but I've also never questioned it more.

I started this week in reading "The Bookmaking Habits of Select Species" by Ken Liu. Originally I tried to find mirrors in how we relate to books in our society - the Hesperoe were philosophers, the Tull-Toks were students, the Quatzoli were historians. But some of these species had a relationship to books that were too abstract to relate to our culture. In class, others spoke about this reading from a broader point of view - how generally can we define a book? how far can we go with this term? It seems, now, that the possibilities are endless.

It is easy to fall into the mindset that the traditional codex (a term I learned from this discussion) is the epitome of "the book". I thought about this while reading both Livingston and Price's works. One part of Livingston's article that resonated with me is our fascination with "the original". Having an old, physical copy of a book feels to have a much greater value than a modern print, or a digital copy. There is something romantic about the past, and the codex embodies this romanticism. Price talks of the sight of a bookstore, that turned out to be an Anthropologie using book decor to promote a certain aesthetic. It is not the codex as a form of media that we are nostalgic for, perhaps, but a glorification of the past that the codex symbolizes.

Transitioning to the digital age heightens nostalgia. In class, we talked about how with new technology, older media becomes more difficult, and in turn is seen as virtuous. I believe this has something to do with the fear of the unknown - in the early ages of the internet, we still do not know what it entails. Classic media becomes a solace for our uncertainty. This is a cycle in our society, though, as a peer brought up in class. Every media, even the codex, went through societal scrutiny when it was considered "new".

The age of technological development we are going through now brings into question how we use it in relation to a book. It seems as though even the e-reader is becoming outdated technology. It appears there are a lot of doors opening for books, as we experiment with new technologies. Looking at this, the definition of a book continues to become broader and broader in my eyes. Putting a definition on "the book" is going to be a tall task, and I am excited to sort out these views as we get deeper into the meat of this class.
