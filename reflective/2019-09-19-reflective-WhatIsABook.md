# Reflective: What Is A Book?

## Looking into the History of the Book

Although I chose a path in STEM as a chemical engineer, I will always have a curiosity for history. I think studying our history is important in understanding our society today, as well as what we might see in the future. Amaranth Borsuk struck my curiosity in *The Book*, looking at how the history of the book impacts both how we interact with it today, as well as what it might mean for the future. Through the reading, class discussion, and our trip to the archives, three main themes emerged in my navigation of the book's history: technology, artistry, and culture.

In Chapter 1 of *The Book*, Borsuk discusses the book as an object. Books emerged as a need for communication beyond the spoken language, first in the form of tablets, then scrolls, and eventually the codex. These media were each technologies, using the resources of the time for efficiency. These, in turn, effected culture. An example I thought was fascinating was the *jiance*. These scrolls were made with the resource available, bamboo. The nature of the bamboo made writing most efficient in vertical fashion. This became part of the written language, and even once other media was developed, vertical writing was embedded in culture. 

In class, we discussed how culture and technology play off of one another. Not only does technology affect culture like the *jiance*, but vice versa. For example, fonts of the printing press were modeled after manuscripts, and word processing fonts were modeled after those of the printing press. These forms were culturally accepted, and so that was how technology was adapted.

I think the aspect of artistry, though, is what takes the book beyond its role of communication. Something that I thought was interesting was the embellishment of medieval manuscripts. The book went beyond the written word, to incorporate an art. At the NU Archives, I was in awe when I saw this illustration in real life (see below). The dragon illustrated in the manuscript was beautiful, and transcended time in a way that the words on the page did not. The book has been a form of art since those times. Nowadays, we push the limits of the book for the sake of art. I like the idea of an art book, using the book in unconventional ways that may, someday, become conventional.

The history of the book seems to cycle, and I see these as cycles of technology, cycles of culture, and cycles of art. I think with the wake of technology today, the future of the book is limitless, in all three aspects.
