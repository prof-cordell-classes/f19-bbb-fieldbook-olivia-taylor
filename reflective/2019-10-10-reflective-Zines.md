# Reflective: Zines

## Discovering the Zine


I had heard the term "zine" but I had never given it much thought. My curiosity was sparked when I saw it as a unit on the syllabus- perhaps there was more to zine than a shorthand term for magazine. Throughout the week, I discovered the world of zines, and it was quite a journey.

Reading part of Pagan Kennedy's *'Zine* set the stage well for me. It was able to introduce an example of the setting of zines, the content, and the affect of zines on the author. I became fascinated by this culture of printing the zines and passing them around to an inner circle, yet gaining fans along the way. It was discussed in class the likeness of zine fame to twitter fame, where you can become an entity solely for your thoughts. I agree with this comparison, but something about zine feels more authentic. Perhaps it is the level of creative effort that I admire, or a sense of nostalgia for a pre-digital age. I cannot say it is truly nostalgia, though, because I was very young during the age of Xerox. Rather, I am romanticizing an age where the world did not live online, as it's easy to see the flaws in this world I know.

Making a zine, I decided my admiration did come from the level of artistic expression. I made my little zine as a handout on climate change. I did not develop the content well enough to be of any use, but the creative process showed me how cathartic this work could be. My zine can be seen in the image below. The most rewarding part of this experience, though, was feeling that I had a voice, and what I had to say was important.

While going through the "Zine Library Code of Ethics," I was not sure what to make of the ethical ambiguity in sharing these works. In an age of social media, my view was that if someone is putting their words out into the world, they are for others to read. Going through the zines in class, though, I found out just how intimate they can be. I picked up a small green-covered zine called "I was a Teenage Mormon." Within just a few pages, the author tells the story of being raped as a child. I felt as though I had read something that was not for my eyes. This was now personal information between the author and I. I was speechless, to the point that I couldn't get myself to participate in the first half of the class discussion that day. The gravity of how personal a zine can be had hit me.

I realized how important having a voice is, to share our stories and to be heard. Zines having a presence in communities of feminists and people of color makes sense, as a way to speak out without the negative feedback that society gives readily. It is important for the author to express their thoughts, and it is of equal importance that these thoughts are heard. I understand  why the "Zine Library Code of Ethics" needed to be so careful with collecting zines. You are dealing with content that is meant to be an intimate experience between author and reader, and in the wrong hands this connection is broken.

From this, I gain more insight into the definition of a book. I had been seeing books mainly as a form of communication, for the author to share their thoughts for the benefit of the reader. Through zines, I realized that books are a form of self-expression for the writer. In that sense, books are for the author; the reader is a subject to fill the necessity of being heard.
