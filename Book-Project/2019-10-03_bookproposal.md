## Book Proposal

This book project will be an individual project, as I am going to tie the content to my personal experiences. I want my book to be about self-growth. I will do this in two ways. The right page will be personal anecdotes and illustrations, similar to a zine. The left side of the page will function as a flip book, as an illustration of a tree growing. The stories and anecdotes will match the progression of the tree, progressing through moments in my life linearly. Although the content of my book will be inspired by zine, I want the format to be printed and bound. I would like most of my text to be printed on the printing press, as I enjoy this process. However, I will add my own illustration to the pages. For the cover, I’d like to incorporate my hobby of sewing, and create a fabric book cover of sorts.
In class, I will gain the skills of printing and binding that I will need for the physical creation of my book. I will also need to teach myself about creating flipbooks and illustration. I will use internet resources to learn the basics, and then practice by creating a sample flipbook. For materials, I will mostly need paper for the pages of my book and art supplies for the illustrations and cover. I should be able to source my materials at an art store, likely Blick. For equipment, I will need the Huskiana Press. Ideally, I will be doing this printing in early November. I plan to have the excerpts written for the prototype, and I will need time to do my illustrations after I print. The Press is the sole piece of equipment I will need to consider for this project.
I think that this project can be evaluated based on physical completion as well as completion of content. In the end, I plan to have a printed, bound book with a unique cover. For the content, I will have a quality flip book image, as well as substantial anecdotes about my personal journey with self-growth. The general time progression of my project is as follows, week 1 representing next week:

Week 1 – Week 3 : Draft the personal anecdotes for the content of my book, as well as brainstorm what each page will look like visually.
Week 4 : Learn to illustrate a flipbook, and create a draft of my tree illustration.

Prototype is due Week 4, including the draft of my flipbook and text.

Week 5 – Week 6 : Print text on the Huskiana Press.
Week 7 – Week 8 : Create the cover, final illustration of my tree, and add text illustrations.

I will try to keep this on an 8-week timeline, in order to use the last week before the project is due as a buffer to setbacks.
